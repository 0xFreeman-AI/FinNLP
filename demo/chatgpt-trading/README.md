# Chatgpt trading

Let's fully use the GPT 3.0 model to create an agent that can trade as smartly as Chatgpt. All of the codes can be found [here](https://github.com/oliverwang15/Alternative-Data/blob/main/demo/chatgpt-trading/main.ipynb)

## 1. About the data

* The Tweets data and price data are all from the [stocknet-dataset](https://github.com/yumoxu/stocknet-dataset)
* We gathered the sentiment score of each tweet generated by the  "text-curie-001" and "text-davinci-003" model and saved the results in the pickle file under `./data`

## 2. Chatgpt trading agent

* To make a trading agent that can be as smart as Chatgpt, we used the GPT model to analyze the sentiment of each day's tweets and use the mean of sentiment scores to make trading decisions. 

* The parameters of the Chatgpt trading agent are:

  ``` python
  "model_name": "text-davinci-003",  # "text-curie-001","text-davinci-003"
  "source": "local",                 # "local","openai"
  "api_key": OPEN_AI_TOKEN,          # not necessary when the "source" is "local"
  "buy_threshold": 0.3,              # the max positive sentiment is 1, so this should range from 0 to 1 
  "sell_threshold": -0.3             # the min negative sentiment is -1, so this should range from -1 to 0
  ```

* The `buy_threshold` and `sell_threshold` may have a huge impact on the final results, so they should be considered carefully.

* We don't suggest using  `openai` for the `source` since free accounts may reach limits quickly.

## 3. Tweets trading environment 

* In order to test the trading ability of the Chatgpt trading agent, a special trading environment was designed. This environment can not only be used for the Chatgpt trading agent but also used for the reinforcement learning. 

* The parameters of the Tweets trading environment are:

  ``` python
  "stock_name" : "AAPL",        # please refer to the stocks provided by stocknet-dataset
  "start_date":"2014-01-01",    # should be later than 2014-01-01
  "end_date":"2015-12-30",    # should be earlier than 2015-12-30
  "init_cash": 100,             # initial avaliable cash
  "init_hold": 0,                 # initial avaliable stock holdings
  "cal_on": "Close",              # The column that used to calculate prices
  "trade_volumn": 100,          # Volumns to trade
  ```

* The start price will be normalized to 1, so `init_cash` denotes shares available for buying, and `init_hold` denotes shares available for selling.

* If  you use `stocknet-dataset` the `cal_on` and be `Close` ,`Adj Close` or even `open`,`high`,`low`.

* The environment will adjust the trading volume automatically when the cash is not enough or the holding is not enough, to make sure that the cash is always >= 0 and the holding is always >= 0.

## 4. Final results

* The result shows that the agent have given buy signals when the stock price was about to raise and sell signals when the stock price was about to drop
